            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that users can successfully navigate
               multi-step processes. It reduces cognitive effort where  information is asked for
               more than once during steps in a process. It also reduces the need to recall information
               provided in a previous  step.
            </p>
            <p>This Success Criterion pertains to the current user session, and is not applicable
               a user returns after closing a session or navigating away.
            </p>
            <p>Information that is required to be remembered for input can pose a significant barrier
               to users with cognitive or memory difficulty. All users experience a natural gradual
               mental fatigue as they proceed through steps in a process. This fatigue is accelerated
               by the stress of recalling information from short-term working memory. Users with
               learning, and cognitive disabilities are highly susceptible to mental fatigue.
            </p>
            <p>Requiring people to recall information already entered in the previous steps can cause
               them to give up or enter incorrect information.
            </p>
            <p>This Success Criterion does not add a requirement to remember information between
               sessions, a <a href="#dfn-process">process</a> is defined on the basis of an activity and does not continue across sessions.
            </p>
            <p>There is an exception for essential uses of input re-entry for things like password
               entry (security), or memory games which would not be possible if the previous answers
               were supplied.

            <ul>
               
               <li>Users with cognitive disabilities experience short-term, working memory difficulty.
                  Not having to repeatedly remember particular information reduces stress and the likelihood
                  of mistakes.
               </li>
               
               <li>Users that experience difficulty forming new memories, recalling information, and
                  other functions related to cognition can complete processes without having to unnecessarily
                  rely on their memory.

            <ul>
               
               <li>A form requests the userâ€™s corporate identification number (ID) in the first step
                  of a process to purchase a new computer. In the 3rd step the user is asked to confirm
                  that the computer will belong to the user (rather than a colleague), and re-shows
                  the ID. It allows the user to change the ID, but defaults to the previously entered
                  one.
               </li>
               
               <li>A form on an e-commerce website allows the user to confirm that the billing address
                  and delivery address are the same address.
