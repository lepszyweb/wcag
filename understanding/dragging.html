            <p>This understanding document is part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/"><strong>draft</strong> WCAG 2.2 content</a>. It may change or be removed before the final WCAG 2.2 is published.

         <section id="intent">
            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure functionality that uses a dragging
               movement (e.g. sliders, drag-and-drop interfaces) has another <a href="#dfn-single-pointer">single pointer</a> mode of operation without the need for the dexterity required to drag elements.
            </p>
            <p>Some people cannot perform dragging motions in a precise manner. Others use a specialized
               or adapted input device such as a head pointer, eye-gaze system, or speech-controlled
               mouse emulator, which makes dragging cumbersome, error-prone, or outright impossible.
            </p>
            <p>When an interface implements functionality that uses dragging motions, some users
               can tap or click, but not accurately maintain contact whilst performing a gesture.
               An alternative method must be provided so that users with mobility impairments that
               use a pointer (mouse, pen, or touch contact) can use the functionality.
            </p>
            <p>There is already a requirement for dragging features to be keyboard accessible, however,
               it is possible to create an interface that works with dragging and keyboard controls
               that does not work using only clicks or taps.

               <li>Users who struggle with performing path-based gestures can still operate an interface

            <ul>
               
               <li>A sortable list of elements may, after focussing a list element, provide adjacent
                  controls for moving the element up or down in the list by simply tapping/clicking
                  on those controls.
               </li>
               
               <li>A kanban implementation may provide an additional pop-up menu for focused elements
                  that can be activated by simple clicks/taps providing an option for moving the selected
                  element to another kanban silo.
               </li>
               
               <li>A radial control widget where the value can be set by dragging includes a text field
                  that presents the current value and offers the input of the desired value via a keyboard
                  (including on-screen virtual keyboards).
               </li>  
               
               <li>A map allows users to drag the view of the map around, and the map has up/down/left/right
                  buttons to move the view as well.
