            <p>This understanding document is part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/"><strong>draft</strong> WCAG 2.2 content</a>. It may change or be removed before the final WCAG 2.2 is published.

         </section>
         <section id="intent">
            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this success criterion is to ensure users can find help for completing
               tasks on a Web site. This is distinct from interface-level help, such as contextual
               help, features like spell checkers, and instructional text in a form. 
            </p>
            <p>Locating the help mechanism in a consistent location across pages makes it easier
               for users to find it.  For example, when a mechanism or link is located in the header
               of a Web page, it will be presented in the header of all pages within the set of Web
               pages.
            </p>
            <p>The location in a smaller viewport may be different than in a larger viewport but
               the mechanism or link will remain in the same location throughout the size.  The location
               should remain consistent both visually and programmatically.
            </p>
            <p>While it would be best for all sites to offer this type of help, the requirement is
               for:
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>single page Web applications, or</li>
               
               <li>any set of Web pages with blocks of content that are repeated on multiple Web pages,</li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>and is actively supported.</p>
            <p>When having problems completing a task on a Web site, people with some types of disabilities
               may not be able to work through the issue without further help.  Issues could include
               difficulty:
               			completing a form, or finding a document or page which provides information required
               to complete a task.
            </p>
            <p>Without help, some users may abandon the task. They may also fail to correctly complete
               a task, or they may require assistance from people who do not necessarily keep private
               information secure.
            </p>
            <p>Self help methods beyond the site, such as using internet search to find the contact
               information for an organization, can be too difficult. Further, the user’s disability
               may make it more difficult to find the help available (such as a “contact us” link,
               phone number, or support page) if the information is not present within a few interactions
               (e.g., displayed in the header, or via a menu). In addition, for some users with disabilities,
               struggling to complete a task on a site may cause additional cognitive challenges
               when searching for help within the site.
            </p>
            <p>When a user is quickly able to find help, they are able to complete the task even
               if they encounter challenges.
            </p>
            <p>At least one of the following mechanisms to get help should be included:</p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>Human contact details such as a phone number, email address, hours of operation.</li>
               
               <li>Human contact mechanism such as a messaging system, chat client, contact form, social
                  media channel.
               </li>
               
               <li>Self-help option such as an up-to-date Frequently Asked Questions, How Do I page,
                  Support page.
               </li>
               
               <li>A fully automated contact mechanism such as a chatbot.</li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>The human contact details should enable the user to connect with the  organization
               or the part of the organization responsible for the content. For example, an online
               jobs / recruitment portal should provide a contact method for the team that supports
               the recruitment portal and not a catch-all for the entire company. Each layer of contact
               added prolongs the time before the user will receive help.
            </p>
            <p>The human contact mechanism enables a person to express what they are looking for
               using their own words. For some with cognitive disabilities, this may be the best
               way for them to find an answer to their problem.
            </p>
            <p>For pages for which no human support is available, a self-help option should say that
               no human support is available.  Self-help options should go beyond allowing the user
               to search within the site. Contextual help is still recommended (See SC 3.3.5 for
               more information) but a self-help option should provide a single location that makes
               it easier for people with cognitive disabilities to understand what help is available
               without having to hunt for it. While some people may easily be able to identify that
               no support would be available for a particular type of Web site, this may not be apparent
               to some users with disabilities.
            </p>
            <p>If a chatbot is provided, it should meet other WCAG success criteria for your conformance
               level. Chatbots which work more effectively for everyone, and particularly for people
               with cognitive disabilities should:
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>recognize misspelled words,</li>
               
               <li>provide human contact details if the chatbot is unable to provide a satisfactory response
                  after 3 attempts, and
               </li>
               
               <li>be dismissed with a single interaction, and recalled using a link or button.</li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>It is not the intent of this Success Criteria to require authors to provide help information
               on PDFs or other static documents that may be available for viewing/download from
               the Web pages. It is also not the intent to require contact information if:
            </p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>A Web site is not supported,</li>
               				
               <li>Content is archived, or </li>
               
               <li>When finding help would invalidate the activity such as in a testing situation. </li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>It is also not the intent of this Success Criteria to require a human be available
               at all times. If the human contact is not available during certain hours or certain
               days, information should be provided so the user can tell when it will be available.

               <li>This Success Criterion helps people who may have difficulty locating help that is
                  not part of the page they are using. Ensuring they can connect with help allows them
                  to complete the task.
               </li>
               
               <li>When a user can easily find help for their specific questions, they are more successful
                  completing tasks.
               </li>
               
               <li>Users that experience cognitive fatigue or cognitive shut down will be able to reserve
                  their energy for the task, instead of using it to find support.
               </li>
               
               <li>Enabling users (especially those with cognitive disabilities) to find solutions while
                  expressing their question using their own words increases their chances of success
                  for completing a task.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
               
               <li>On-line job application - Some of the application questions may be hard for new job
                  seekers to understand even after reading the contextual help. For example, the form
                  may request their identification number, but they may have several and not know which
                  one to enter. Easily findable contact information will enable them to use phone or
                  email so they can get an answer to their question.
               </li>   
               
               <li>Medical appointment scheduling form - When the service a patient is trying to book
                  is not easily findable within the interface, they may need human help. A built-in
                  messaging option (chat client) enables them to quickly interact with a staff person
                  that can help, without requiring them to manage a second interface.
               </li>   
               
               <li>Finding a specific policy or procedure - An employee who needs to complete a work
                  task may have difficulty locating the specific policy or procedure document on their
                  employer’s Web site. A How Do I page may include the information that enables them
                  to independently complete this task.
               </li>
