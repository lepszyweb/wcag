            <p>This understanding document is part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/"><strong>draft</strong> WCAG 2.2 content</a>. It may change or be removed before the final WCAG 2.2 is published.

         <section id="intent">
            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that controls needed to progress
               or complete a process can be easily found by people with cognitive disabilities when
               they are needed.  
            </p>
            <p>People with low executive function, impaired memory, and other cognitive and learning
               disabilities may not be able to find controls needed to progress if they are hidden
               until focus is placed on them or a pointer hovers over them. They may also not remember
               where the control is the next time they interact with the site.
            </p>
            <p>Some design approaches hide controls needed to complete tasks and require certain
               user interactions, such as mouse-over, to display these controls. These required interactions
               can leave users with cognitive disabilities without a path forward.   
            </p>
            <p>Controls should be visible without user interaction (i.e., persistently visible) when
               they are needed to progress.  In multistep processes or multipart forms, the control
               may be hidden in an earlier step/part, however, at the time the user can move forward
               the control needs to be persistently visible without having interacted with the control.
               Similarly, this SC does not require inactive controls to be persistently visible until
               the user is able to progress. For example, when a form includes required fields be
               completed before the submit button becomes active, the submit button does not need
               to be persistently visible while it is inactive.
            </p>
            <p>When multiple controls are included in a single location, some indication of those
               controls such as a drop down indicator should be visible without user interaction.
               
            </p>
            <p>In some cases, controls are provided in multiple locations on a page or at multiple
               points within a process. In these cases, at least one of the instances of the controls
               needs to be visible without user interaction.  For example, in an email process, some
               controls such as trash may be visible using pointer hover in the list of emails but
               are always visible on the view of the email itself. Because the controls are persistently
               visible when needed on the email view, they do not need to persistently visible on
               the list of emails. 
            </p>
            <p>The intent of this SC is to help individuals with cognitive and learning disabilities
               locate controls they need to successfully complete their desired task.  The controls
               addressed in this SC should also meet the SC for sufficient text (1.4.3/1.4.6) and
               non-text (1.4.11) contrast. 
            </p>
            <p>Controls such as video players, web chats, and carousels include controls that are
               only visible on hover since they overlay the contents being displayed.  These controls
               are not considered a process in terms of this SC but occasionally completing a process
               requires interacting with one of these controls. For example, completing training
               may require the user watch a video before proceeding to the next step. In this case,
               a control needed to play the video needs to be visibly persistent. This may be accomplished
               by making the video controls all visibly persist or by adding a redundant play control
               to the page.

               <li><strong>Web Editor Success</strong>: In a web editor, once a page is open for editing, all the possible locations for

               <li><strong>Web Editor Success</strong>: In a web editor, the possible locations for editing are hidden until a user hovers
                  over them but a radio button in settings can be changed so that the icons are all
                  shown by default.

               <li><strong>Email Success</strong>: When writing an email, controls needed to trash or forward the email are hidden
                  by hover on the email list page but visually persist at the top of the email screen.
