         <p>Success Criterion <a href="https://lepszyweb.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#focus-appearance-enhanced" style="font-weight: bold;">2.4.12 Focus Appearance (Enhanced)</a> (Level AAA): For the keyboard focus indicator of each User Interface Component, all of the following
            are true:
         </p>
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               <strong>Minimum area:</strong> The <a href="#dfn-focus-indication-area">focus indication area</a> is greater than or equal to a 2 <a href="#">CSS pixel</a> solid border around the control.
            </li>
            
            <li>
               <strong>Change of contrast:</strong> Color changes used to indicate focus have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 with
               the colors changed from the unfocused control.
            </li>
            
            <li>
               <strong>Unobscured:</strong> No part of the focus indicator is hidden by author-created content.

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure a keyboard focus indicator is highly
               visible. This criterion is closely related to <a href="./focus-appearance-minimum.html">Success Criterion 2.4.11 Focus Appearance (Minimum)</a> and defines a higher level of visibility for the focus indicator.
            </p>
            <p>In relation to Focus Visible (enhanced) this criterion:</p>
            <ul>
               
               <li>Expands the minimum area from 1 CSS pixel around the perimeter of the element to 2
                  CSS pixels around the perimeter.
               </li>
               
               <li>Increases the change of contrast to 4.5:1.</li>
               
               <li>Does not allow for any part of the element to be obscured by other content.</li>

            <p>The other aspects of the success criterion are the same as Focus Visible (Minimum).</p>

                  executive processes benefit by being able to discover where the focus is located.
