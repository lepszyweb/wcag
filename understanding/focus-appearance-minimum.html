         <p>Success Criterion <a href="https://lepszyweb.github.io/wcag/guidelines/#focus-appearance-minimum" style="font-weight: bold;">2.4.11 Focus Appearance (Minimum)</a> (Level AA): For the keyboard focus indicator of each User Interface Component, all of the following
            are true:
         </p>
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               <strong>Minimum area:</strong> The <a href="#dfn-focus-indication-area">focus indication area</a> is greater than or equal to a 1 <a href="#">CSS pixel</a> border of the focused control, or has a thickness of at least 8 CSS pixels along
               the shortest side of the element.
            </li>
            
            <li>
               <strong>Change of contrast:</strong> The color change for the focus indication area has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1
               with the colors of the unfocused state.
            </li>
            
            <li>
               <strong>Adjacent contrast:</strong> The focus indication area has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against all adjacent
               colors for the minimum area or greater, or has a thickness of at least 2 CSS pixels.
            </li>
            
            <li>
               <strong>Unobscured:</strong> The item with focus is not entirely hidden by author-created content.
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         <p class="note">A keyboard focus indicator which has a pattern or gradient may have parts that do
            not meet the 3:1 contrast ratio for the change of contrast, as long as an area equal
            to the minimum does meet the contrast ratio.
         </p>
         <p class="note">If the control has a visible boundary smaller than the hit area, the size measure
            is taken from the visible boundary.
         </p>

            <p>This understanding document is part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/"><strong>draft</strong> WCAG 2.2 content</a>. It may change or be removed before the final WCAG 2.2 is published.

            <h2>Intent</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure a keyboard focus indicator is clearly
               visible and discernible. This criterion is closely related to <a href="../20/focus-visible.html">SC 2.4.7 focus visible</a> and defines a minimum level of visibility.
            </p>
            <p>For sighted people with mobility impairments who use a keyboard-like device (e.g.
               a switch, voice input), knowing the current point of focus is very important. Visible
               focus must also meet the needs of low-vision users, who may also be keyboard-only
               users.
            </p>
            <p>A keyboard focus indicator can take different forms, this success criterion sets a
               requirement to make it clearly distinguishable. For example, using a thick outline
               around the control that contrasts with the background would pass this criterion.

               <h3>Keyboard focus</h3>
               
               <p>The keyboard focus is the point of interaction for someone using a keyboard. For environments
                  with a keyboard operable interface, the keyboard focus can be moved around the interface
                  in order to interact with different elements. Whichever element is being interacted
                  with has focus.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>In web pages some components may receive focus as a user presses the tab key to move
                  to that component and then use the arrow keys to select an option (e.g. tabs, menu
                  items). The item considered to be focused is whichever is being interacted with. For
                  example, if you tab to a menu and arrow-down to a menu item, it is the menu item that
                  is in focus as pressing enter would activate the menu item.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>Some elements can take focus (such as the target of a skip link), however, it is only
                  when the element is operable by keyboard controls that this criterion applies.
               </p>

               <h3>Minimum area</h3>
               
               
               <p>The bigger the visible change, the easier it is for someone to see. Authors are encouraged
                  to make the change as significant as possible, for example, by designing a thick border
                  around the element, or significantly changing the background color.
               </p>

                  <p>A border is the perimeter of the control, and defines its shape. A border is not a
                     reference to the CSS property of the same name.
                  </p>
               </div>
               
               
               <p>The minimum size of the focus indicator must be at least the area taken by a 1 CSS
                  pixel border around the element. The indicator does not have to be a border, but the
                  size of the area must be at least that size. For example, if a control is a rectangle
                  of 90px wide and 30px tall, the size of the outer border is 90 + 90 + 30 + 30 = 240
                  CSS pixels.

                  <p>A <a href="#">CSS pixel</a> is what developers use in CSS declarations like “width: 200px”, it is device-independent
                     and not to be confused with device pixels which vary depending on the physical pixel
                     density. <br />
                     The rest of this document notates CSS pixels as "px".

               <p>The following 3 examples use a 90px wide by 30px tall button, therefore the surface
                  area requirement is 240px. The middle button is focused in each example.

                     but using a 2px thick indicator means it is well over the minimum requirement of 180px
                     squared.

                  <figcaption>Figure 3@@@ Update.The thick (3px) yellow underline is almost as long as the longest edge
                     therefore meets the requirement.

               <p>If controls change size across different variations of a page (e.g. in a responsive
                  design), it helps to use a proportionally sized indicator such as an outline or background
                  change. In that way you can be sure of meeting the size requirement.
               </p>
               
               
               <p>Typical focus indicators:</p>
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>An outline around the whole component would pass the size requirement;</li>
                  
                  <li>Changing the background of a control would pass the size requirement;</li>
                  
                  <li>A 1px wide vertical line (such as a blinking cursor) would <strong>not pass</strong> the size requirement, a text input would need a larger or separate focus indicator.
                  </li>
                  
               </ul>
               
               
               <p>If you need to use complex mathematics to work out if a focus indicator is large enough,
                  it is probably a sign that you should use a larger and proportional indicator that
                  will provide a more visible indicator.
               </p>

                  <h4>Unusual shapes and gradients</h4>
                  
                  
                  <p>If you have an unusual shape, some mathematics may be required if the focus indicator
                     is on the edge of the size requirement. For example, if the focusable control is a
                     circle with a diameter of 100px, the circumference would be 314 pixels. A 1px (or
                     greater) outline would meet the size criteria.

                  <p>If a focus indicator is an irregular shape, such as a drop-shadow under a star icon,
                     it helps if the contrasting area is obviously quite large.

                  <p>What is the contrasting area of the drop shadow? The quick method is:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>Look at the size of the component, how long is it around the edges?</li>
                     
                     <li>Look at the (contrasting) area of the focus indicator.</li>
                     
                     <li>Mentally compare the focus indicator to the border of the component.</li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  
                  <p>If it is too close to call, you could extract the contrasting area of the focus indicator
                     and evaluate the surface area.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>If a focus indicator has a gradient, the principle is to measure the contrast of the
                     changed area, and ignore the change that does not meet 3:1.

                     <figcaption>Figure 6When a gradient is used on a focus indictor, the measure of surface area should only

                  <p>If you take some spot-checks on the gradient area and establish what area meets the
                     contrast, it is straightforward to work out if that area is sufficient.

               <p>The greater the change of contrast between states the easier it is for users to see

               <p>When a component changes to include a focus indicator, that change can always be measured
                  as a change of color contrast. For example, if a yellow outline is added to a button
                  on a blue background, the change of color is from blue to yellow.
